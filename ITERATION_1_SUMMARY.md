# Progress Summary – Iteration 1

## Completed Features

**Project Structure**: Full MERN stack setup with separate frontend (React) and backend (Express) directories, containerized deployment architecture.

**Complete Routing**: 5 UI routes implemented - Dashboard (/), Assets (/assets), Tasks (/tasks), Team (/team), and Versions (/versions) using React Router DOM.

**Database Architecture**: In-memory database with structured data models for assets, tasks, users, and game versions to ensure deployment stability.

**RESTful API**: 4 working GET endpoints for core entities (Assets, Tasks, Users, Versions) with JSON responses and health monitoring.

**Dual Deployment**: Frontend deployed to Google Cloud App Engine; backend containerized and deployed to Google Cloud Run with proper CORS configuration.

**Bootstrap UI Integration**: Custom gaming-themed interface using React Bootstrap with Badge, Alert, and Fade components not featured in demo applications.

**Team Management System**: User status tracking, role management, and activity monitoring with online/offline indicators.

**Task Board Implementation**: Kanban-style task management with status tracking (To Do, In Progress, Completed) and priority levels (High, Medium, Low).

**Asset Library**: Game asset management system with categorization, tagging, file type tracking, and metadata storage.

**Version Control Integration**: Game version tracking with associated assets, task completion status, and release milestone management.

## Issues Resolved

**Submodule Conflicts**: Resolved Git submodule issues where frontend directory was incorrectly tracked as submodule, preventing proper Netlify deployment.

**Node.js Runtime Compatibility**: Updated all deployment configs from nodejs18 to nodejs20 to meet Google Cloud App Engine requirements.

**Google Cloud Deployment Errors**: Fixed Docker container startup timeouts by simplifying database architecture and optimizing container configuration.

**CORS Configuration**: Resolved cross-origin issues between GitHub Pages/App Engine frontend and Google Cloud Run backend services.

**Bootstrap Component Integration**: Successfully integrated React Bootstrap components while maintaining custom gaming theme and responsive design.

**Package Management**: Resolved Node.js version compatibility issues between React Router v7 and current Node.js environment.
